Welcome to Escape Rooms Adventure!

A live-action puzzle game where players are locked in themed rooms and must 
use their problem-solving skills to solve a series of challenges and riddles in
order to escape the rooms. 

Here you will compete against 4 other players while trying to successfully
complete the task in each Adventure Room. As the main player, you pick the
Escape Room that players will compete in until no rooms remain. NOTE that you 
can only choose an Escape Room once, so choose WISELY. After every Escape Room
coins are awarded, a podium and scoreboard are displayed, and the player 
with the least amount of coins will be eliminated before the next room. If you
get eliminated before completing all the rooms the game will end.

The objective of the game is to not be eliminated and to have the most amount 
of coins after completing all of the Escape Rooms.
