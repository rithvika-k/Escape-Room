# Escape-Room

Escape Rooms Adventure Game

A live-action puzzle game where players are locked in a themed room and must 
use their problem-solving skills to solve a series of challenges and riddles in
order to escape the room. 

Here the user will compete against 4 other players while trying to successfully
complete the task in each Adventure Room. As the main player, they will pick the
Escape Room that players will compete in until no rooms remain. NOTE that the user 
can only choose an Escape Room once, so they should choose WISELY. After every Escape Room
coins are awarded, a podium and scoreboard are displayed, and the player 
with the least amount of coins will be eliminated before the next room. If the main player
(the user) gets eliminated before completing all the rooms the game will end.

The objective of the game is to not be eliminated and to have the most amount of coins after completing all of the Escape Rooms.
